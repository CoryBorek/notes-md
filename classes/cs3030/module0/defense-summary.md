**Each week, you need to summarize the work you did for a module according to this rubric.** Unless specified otherwise, all content is to be written in your own words. Please prepare a suitably formatted PDF document that contains the necessary sections listed below, one section per page. Formatting guidelines are presented at the bottom of this rubric. Each defense summary document should be submitted before the associated module's defense summary deadline via eLC. Each defense summary is graded based on its content along with your actual recitation videos and responses -- the scores you provide in your defense summary do not determine your grade; instead, it's determined by your conformance to this rubric.

Reading Summary (15%)

In one (1) to two (2) paragraphs, briefly summarize the reading assigned for the module. This should be a summary and not an outline.

Additionally, list two (2) things, in one paragraph each, that you found most surprising, intriguing, or challenging to you about this reading. In order to receive full points you must provide reasoning for your choices.

Reading Questions (5%)

Provide a bulleted list two (2) separate multiple choice questions related to the reading with five (5) potential answers each. A multiple choice question should have exactly one answer. Be sure to indicate which answer is correct for each question.

Also provide a bulleted list two (2) separate multiple select questions related to the reading with five (5) potential answers each. A multiple select question should have one or more correct answers -- two or more is preferred. Be sure to indicate which subset of answers are correct for each question.

"My" Recitation (40%)

_Thesis and Sources:_ Clearly state your thesis. Also provide a bulleted list of sources that are consistently formatted according to MLA, APA, or Chicago/Turabian guidelines.

_Self Score:_ Based on the "[Video Recitation Rubric](%WEBPATH%/classes/cs3030/module0/rubric)" on eLC, what grade do you think you deserve for each of the criteria in the rubric and why? This is essentially the same thing that you are asked to do when you peer review another student’s submission, except in this case you are reviewing yourself.

_First Responder:_ Provide the name of the first student who responded to your recitation along with the score that they gave you (out of 25). Based on the comments provided by that student, what aspects of future recitations will you actively seek to improve?

_Second Responder:_ Provide the name of the second student who responded to your recitation along with the score that they gave you (out of 25). Based on the comments provided by that student, what aspects of future recitations will you actively seek to improve?

**NOTE:** If you did not receive one or more peer reviews, write the name of your group mate who did not respond and "I did not receive this peer review." Do not leave the section blank.  You may receive a penalty if you leave the section blank.

"My" Peer Reviews (40%)

_First Peer Review:_ Provide the name of the first student who you peer reviewed, the the score that you gave them, and a copy of your comments. Additionally, write a sentence or two about how you might adjust your own work in the future based on this student's video.

_Second Peer Review:_ Provide the name of the second student who you peer reviewed, the the score that you gave them, and a copy of your comments. Additionally, write a sentence or two about how you might adjust your own work in the future based on this student's video.

**NOTE:** If you did not do one or more peer reviews, then please write "I did not complete this peer review." under an appropriate sub-heading instead of leaving the section blank. If your group mate hasn't posted their video after the recitation deadline, state that in your defense summary.

**PENALTY**:  If you do not submit your responses to your group mates on time, your defense summary will lose 10 points for each missed response.

Here is information related to formatting:

Front Matter and Headers

Your document must start with a title page that includes the following parts, with values substituted appropriately:

1.  Module N Defense Summary
2.  Prepared for  
    CSCI 3030E Computing, Ethics, and Society  
    Summer 2024  
    University of Georgia  
    Athens, GA, USA
3.  Prepared by  
    Full Name  
    University of Georgia  
    Athens, GA, USA  
    ugaemail@uga.edu
4.  Month, Day, Year

Each individual part of the front matter should adhere to the "Text Format" information listed below, except that each part should also be centered both horizontally and vertically centered and separate by four spaces. The first part of the front matter may be bolded. An example title page can be found [here](front-matter.pdf).

Text Format

In your document, use one inch (1") margins, single-space the text, and use one of the following fonts: [Times New Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman), [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)), [Arial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial), or [Dyslexie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexie). Whatever font you choose, be sure that the regular and italics type styles contrast enough such that they are recognizable from one another. The font size should be 10 to 12 pt.

Section Format

Each section (not sub-section) should start on its own page. The first line of a section should be the section title. Please be consistent.

File Format

Regardless of the program you use to prepare your document, you are required to submit it in PDF format. Oftentimes you can simply "Print to PDF" -- if you have trouble figuring out how to save your document as a PDF file, then you may find some of the following links helpful:
