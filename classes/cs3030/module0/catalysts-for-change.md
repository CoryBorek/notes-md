   - Lockdowns made people dependant on digital devices
   - IT enabled people to do jobs, attend school from home
 - Importance
   - Pandemic revealed "digital divide"
   - Students with up to date computers and high-speed Internet access could engage fully in online learning
   - Millions of students from low-income families lacked essentials and fell behind.

## Our relationship with technology
 - Technologies solve problems, but may create new problems
   - Automobiles
     - Greater mobility
     - Time wasted in traffic jams
   - Web
     - Supports valuable information retrevial tools

   - Low cost international communication
     - Global access to news, entertainment
     - Jobs outsourced from United States to less expensive job markets.

## Discussion Question 1
Do you tend to acquire new technological devides before or after most of your friends? What are the advantages of being an early adopter of a new technology? What are the advantages of being a late adopter of a new technology?

### Cory's Answer
When it comes to hardware, I generally am a late adopter. This usually means that whatever I purchase is generally known to be of good quality, and has been proven by others to work.

When it comes to software, I usually am an early adopter. I do see the issues in the software, but can provide insight to the developer, and my ideas may end up in the software, benefitting others. Overall, I eventually become a happy customer, and the business gains more customers, providing a win-win.

## Discussion Question 2
Have you ever gone camping or had another expereince where you went for at least a few days without access to a phone, radio, television, or computer? (in other words, there was no communication between you and the outside world.) What did you learn from your experience?

### Cory's Answer
I grew up in Scouting, and am an Eagle Scout. I have spent many times out in the wilderness, enjoying the scenery. Being away from your devices for a time really allows you to take in the scenery, and enjoy the present. Not worrying about the future or the past. I used to try to spend a month a year where I do not do any major tasks on a computer, usualy coenciding with me travelling, or camping. It gives me a chance to learn, calm down, and reflect. I really enjoy those times, and often come back with a new drive to work, and a greater appreciation for the technology we have.

## Discussion Quesiton
The story of Altair BASIC highlights a clash between those who see software as something to be developed and freely shared among computer enthusiasts and those who see software development as an entrepreneurial activity. What are some contemporary examples that illustrate these contrasting views of software?

### Cory's Answer
The views of the Free Software Foundation, can be on the more extreme end, so I will share that. They believe that all software should be freely accessible to all, for any purposes, and that the source code should be publicly available for anyone to compile, modify, and share.

According to the [FSF](https://fsf.org/about) Free software is about having control over the technology we use in our homes, schools,a nd businesses, where computers work for our individual and communial benefit, not for proprietary software companies or governments who might seek to restrict and monitor us.

On the other hand, there are proprietary software companies like Microsoft, of whom share little, if any code within their software, and have very restrictive licenses that are very difficult to parse, that are meant to benefit the company and profit above all else.

## Discussion Question
The telephone has eroted traditional social hierarchies. Has email had the same effect within colleges and universities?

Do you ever send emails to someone you would be uncomfortable talking to personally? If so, are the emails effective?

### Cory's Answer
I find talking to people in a position of authority to be very difficult and stressful. Sending an email is a much easier way to send information, and can be faster, andeasier to get my point across without missaying anything. It can be effective.

On the other hand, not everyone checks their emails. That can be an issue when it comes to getting information across.

Yeah. Over time, people are becoming more and more accustomed to less and less of their data bein their own. Not just cloud storage, but social media, heck, even targeted advertisements from just browsing the web.

# Information Technology Issues

## Information Technology
 - Definition of Information technology:
   - Devices used in creation, storage, manipulation, exchange, and dissemination of data, including text, sound, and images
 - Examples of IT
   - Tablets, smartphones, laptop computers
 - People making greater use of IT
   - Costs keep falling
   - capabilities keep rising

## IT Issues
 - Pirating copyrighted content

### Cory's Answer
Short-form social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram and YouTube Shorts. I feel that it is causing people to have an ever less attention span, and is wasting
our productive time.

# Views of Technology

## Overview
 - Approach to IT issues influenced by views of technology
 - Five views of technology discussed here
   - Instrumentalism
   - Pragmatism
   - Technological determinism
   - Cultural approach to technology
   - Decolonial technical design

## Technology
 - Definition of Technology
   - Application of engineering knowledge to solve practical problems
 - Examples of technological products
   - Tools
   - Machines
   - Software

## Instrumentalism
 - Technological devices are instruments created by engineers to achieve ends dictated by society
 - Focus is on benefits of technology
 - Technology expands human capabilities, which is desirable.
 - Neutrality thesis
   - Technology is neither good nor bad
   - Users determine whether it is put to good use or bad use
   - "Guns don't kill people; people kill people"

## Argument against Neutrality Thesis
 - Qualities of well-constructed technological devices
   - Efficently achieve design goals
   - Less efficient at accomplishing other goals
 - Thus, connection between technologies and other goals
 - Moral value of goals "rubs off" on technologies

## Pragamatism
 - Focuses on role of technological devices in solving problems
 - However, technology not value neutral
 - Value of technology dependent on social context
 - Example: Steam-heating plants
   - Viewed positively in 1880s because cleaner, more efficient than alternatives
   - Viewed negatively in 2020s, because of greenhouse gas concerns; cleaner alternatives are available

## Technological Determinism
 - Technological advancements most important driver of social, economic, cultural change
 - "You can't stop progress"
 - Historical examples
   - Turks Had gunpowder -> created Ottoman Empire
   - Invention of printing press -> Creation of nation states

## Cultural approach to Technology
 - Technology is an expression of human culture
 - Technology is value-laden
   - It can make accomplishing some goals easier
   - It can make accomplising other goals more difficult
 - Example: Invention of telephone
   - Facilitated long-distance communication
   - Eroded traditional social hierarchies
   - Generated new concerns about privacy

## Decolonial Technological Design
 - Coloniality
   - Inferiority of colonized people internalized by descendants of colonizers and colonized
   - Symptoms
     - Ex-colonized people believe they cannot develop high quality technologies
     - North American/European believe they can solve problems in developing nations without consultation
 - Decolonial technical design: coloniality can be overcome by collaborative design process


# Summary
 - We are living in the Information Age, but information technology has a long history
 - Today's devices are a culmination of centuries of incremental progress
 - Social conditions give rise to new technologies
 - Adoption of technologies can change society
 - Computing professionals have a responsibility to be thoughtful about their role in creating the future.
