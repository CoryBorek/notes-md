Computer Ethics

The idea of a computer ethics course may sound intimidating! Unlike other computer science courses that focus on technical computing content, this course focuses on people and the decisions they make. Determining the right thing to do is not like finding the maximum element on a list. The moral problems discussed in this course are complicated, and there are no set algorithms that enable you to "solve" a moral problem as neatly as you construct append elements to a linked list or array. Fortunately, there are methodologies that enable you to form constructive ethical arguments, some of which we will explicitly explore throughout this course. C. Martin and H. Holz put it a nice way:

> Our belief is that ethics cannot be taught; rather what can be taught is a framework for evaluating ethical dilemmas and making decisions. In accepting the premise that technology is value-laden, we stress the need to teach a methodology of explicit ethical analysis in all decision-making related to technology... The role of ethics education should be to provide students with at least a minimal theoretical background essential for their understanding of the role that values and ethics play in all decision-making, whether it be technical, economic, political, social, or personal.
> 
> C. Martin and H. Holz in Non-Apologetic Computer Ethics Education: A Strategy for Integrating Social Impact and Ethics into the Computer Science Curriculum

As such, the _focus of this course_ is on _defining and defending_ your _ethical choices_ using one or more workable systems of ethical decision making -- the so-called _workable ethical theories_. Furthermore, this focus rallies around the context of computing and society. We all live in society and, these days, interact with computing technologies on a daily basis. However, many of us lack the historical and background knowledge the computing technology that we use. M. Quinn, the author of the textbook for this course, comments on the need for context in computer ethics:

> A thoughtful response to information technology requires a basic understanding of its history, an awareness of current information-technology-related issues, and a familiarity with ethics.
> M. Quinn (2011) in Ethics for the Information Age

In summary, when you make an ethical decision, you want to be able to convince both yourself and others. If an ethical argument were a stone building that you construct, then the ethical theories provide the foundation and scaffolding while the history and background knowledge provide the mortar that fills the gaps and, perhaps, provides compelling decoration.

## Course Layout

This online course is broken up into weekly modules. For each module, you are responsible for the following:

Readings and Quizzes

Throughout the semester, readings will be posted to eLC. Sometimes these will chapters from the textbook. Other times these will be links to articles, interviews, videos, etc. Textbook slides are provided, however, they are not a complete substitute for the textbook itself. Readings are made available when the module becomes available on Saturday mornings.

There is an online reading quiz associated with each reading. The time limit for each quiz is one hour per attempt; you get two attempts. Each reading quiz is due Monday night.

Recitation Videos

For each module, you are required to post one recitation video in response to a set of prepared recitation topics. In each recitation you state and defend an ethical thesis within the context of the topic. We recommend the [loom](https://www.loom.com/) platform for creating and hosting your video.  Each submitted video will be assessed using the [Video Recitation Rubric](%WEBPATH%/classes/cs3030/module0/rubric). These recitation videos are due Wednesday night.

After the deadline for a particular recitation video, you are required to peer review two other students according to the [Video Response Rubric](%WEBPATH%/classes/cs3030/module0/response). Peer review groups are assigned randomly on eLC for each recitation. These peer reviews are to be completed by Friday night. **NOTE:** eLC shows the peer review deadline and not the actual video deadline. Although eLC may let you submit your video late, you run the risk of violating the Late Work policy described later in this syllabus.

Defense Summary

Instead of providing individual grades in the grade book for each recitation video and response, you will be assessed for each module using a defense summary that you will provide according to the [Defense Summary Rubric](%WEBPATH%/classes/cs3030/module0/defense-summary). In the defense summary, you will compile information about the work that you did for the week and provide and provide honest commentary on how you did or did not fulfill any requirements. Each defense summary is due Sunday night.

Here is what a typical week in this class looks like:

##### MON

**Submit last reading quiz attempt** for this week's reading set.

##### WED

**Post a recitation video** in the class discussion board following the [Video Recitation Rubric](%WEBPATH%/classes/cs3030/module0/rubric).

##### FRI

**Complete two peer reviews** following the [Video Response Rubric](%WEBPATH%/classes/cs3030/module0/response).

##### SAT

New module becomes available on eLC.

##### SUN

**Submit a weekly defense summary** in the assignment dropbox following the [Defense Summary Rubric](%WEBPATH%/classes/cs3030/module0/defense-summary).

You are actively encouraged to complete assignments before their respective deadlines. If you have any general questions, then feel free to ask them on Piazza.

## Grading Policy

Numerical final course grades are calculated using the "Point Breakdown" table provided. The letter grade that a student receives in this course will be the direct mapping of their numerical final course grade to a +/- letter grade using the intervals in the "Letter Grade Breakdown" table. Students should neither expect nor ask for any rounding to occur.

### Letter Grade Breakdown
| Interval | Grade | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \[93, ∞) | A   |     |
| \[90, 93) | A-  |     |
| \[87, 90) | B+  |     |
| \[83, 87) | B   |     |
| \[80, 83) | B-  |     |
| \[77, 80) | C+  |     |
| \[73, 77) | C   | This grade and above reflects achievement that meets the basic course requirements. |
| \[70, 73) | C-  | This grade is not considered a "C" or better for graduation requirements. |
| \[60, 70) | D   | This grade is technically still passing, however, it reflects achievement that does not fully meet the basic course requirements. |
| \[0, 60) | F   | Failing. |

### Point Breakdown
| Category | Percent | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reading Quizzes | 10% | There is a one hour time limit for each quiz attempt. You get two attempts per quiz. |
| Defense Summaries | 65% | An individual defense summary grade does not merely reflect the summary itself. It also reflects the work being summarized. |
| Final Exam | 25% | Information about the final exam can be found [here](/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=3558330&type=content&rcode=usgq-14292730). |

## Final Exam

Per university policy, the final exam is a summative evaluation of the entire term's work or a portion of the term's work. In this course, the exam will include  multiple sections and different question types. Information about the final exam can be found [here](/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=3558330&type=content&rcode=usgq-14292730).

Final Exam Policy

Students who have not registered for the course will not be permitted to view or submit the final examination, and only under extraordinary circumstances will they be allowed to view and submit the final examination unless they have submitted at least 50 percent of the _total_ work assigned in the course.

## Additional Course Policies and Statements

Academic Honesty Policy

All academic work must meet the standards contained in [A Culture of Honesty](https://honesty.uga.edu/). Each student is responsible for knowing those standards before performing academic work. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

Discussion Policy

You may absolutely discuss general (i.e., not assignment-specific) CSCI 3030E concepts with anyone, including other current students. This explicitly includes lecture materials, information in the textbook, posted readings, and general Piazza questions.

Piazza Policy

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion and official announcements. Piazza announcements are considered official course announcements. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email `team@piazza.com`. Although you may receive an enrollment email to your UGA email account before class begins, it is your responsibility to ensure that you are enrolled in the course on Piazza.

If your question is private in nature, then you have the option to create a private post to the "Instructors" group on Piazza. To do this, select "Individual Student(s) / Instructor(s)" for the "Post to" option when creating a new post and type in "Instructors". Note, Piazza gets a lot of posts, so it sometimes takes us a while to sort through it all. Please allow 24-hours for a response on a weekday, and 48-hours for a response on the weekend or holiday/break.

Video Policy

This term we will be using eLC discussion groups to facilitate recitations and peer reviews. You may use the loom platform to create and host your video then can paste the link in the discussion topic on eLC.

Collaboration & Group Work Policy

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all assignments are to be completed individually. Collaboration on argument construction is not allowed, except under the explicit direction of your instructor. You may share sources with other students, however, you may not discuss the implementation of any of your written or verbal arguments prior to the submission of the related assignment.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all assignments are to completed individually. From time to time, some assignments may explicitly indicate an option for group work. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, when participating in a group assignment, all group members are equally responsible for jointly producing all assignment artifacts. All students in a group, therefore, will receive the same grade for the assignment. For all assignments involving group work, students agree this syllabus policy in addition to any other requirements outlined in an assignment’s description. Groups who submit group work that was not completed in accordance with this policy will be considered to be in violation of the University's Academic Honesty policy.

Video Dress Code Policy

In any video of yourself that is submitted as part of assignment for this course, you shall not not dress, groom, wear, or use emblems, insignias, badges, or other symbols or lewd or vulgar words where the effect thereof is offensive to a reasonable person or otherwise causes disruption or interference with the orderly operations of the course. Your dress, grooming, and personal hygiene must be appropriate just as if you were attending class in person.

Late Work Policy

Work not received by its associated deadline will not be graded and will be assigned a "0" in the grade book. Exceptions will only be made under extenuating circumstances such a serious medical injury, bereavement, trauma, or mandatory court attendance provided that a written request is made to the instructor that is timely and includes appropriate evidence to support the extenuating circumstance. Scheduled maintenance of University systems is not considered an extenuating circumstance.

Dropped Grades

Students’ lowest quiz grade and the lowest defense summary grade will be dropped.

Regrading

In order to be considered for regrading, students must send a regrade request through piazza within 3 days after the grade was posted on eLC.

Online Learning Statement

This course will be taught 95% or more online. The course content is delivered fully online; students will utilize the features of eLC and other tools to access a variety of experiences involving text and multimedia presentations of content. Students are expected to fully engage with all course-related materials.

Disability and Health-Related Statement

Students with a disability or health-related issue who need a class accommodation should make an appointment to speak with the instructor as soon as possible.

Communication Statement

You are always encouraged to contact the instructional staff whenever you have a question or concern that should not be addressed via a public post in the course's Piazza forum. However, please do NOT directly email the instructor or TAs! Instead, please post such questions on Piazza via a private message as described earlier in this syllabus.

Syllabus Statement

The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.

Artificial Intelligence Software

Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as ChatGPT, must not be used when completing assignments
