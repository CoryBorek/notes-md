# Introduction to Ethics

# We Live In Communities

## Living in Communities
 - Benefits
    - More secure against external dangers
    - Facilitate exchange of goods and services
    - Higher standard of living from economic specialization
    - Opportunities for fulfilling personal relationships
  - Costs
    - Certain actions are prohibited
    - Other actions are obligitary
    - Nonconformance can lead to punishment
  - Communities exist because benefits outweigh the costs

## The Ethical point of view
 - Most everyone shares "core values", desiring:
   - Life,
   - Happiness
   - Agency (ability to accomplish goals)
 - Two ways to view the world
    - Selfish point of view: consider only your own self and your core values
    - Ethical point of view: respect other people and their core values

## Defining Terms
 - Society
   - Association of people organized under a system of rules
   - Rules: advance the good of members over time
 - Morality:
   - A society's rules of conduct
   - What people ought / outght not to do in various situations
 - Ethics
   - Rational examination of morality
   - Evaluation of people's behavior

## Discussion Question 1

What is an example of a contemporary inforamtion technology issue for which our society's moral guidelines seem to be nonexistant or unclear? (Hint: think about issues that are getting a lot of media coverage)

### Cory's answer
I think that posts on social media could be an issue, as a lot of people will post some insane stuff on there for "content" without looking at any consequences. Think "influencers" like Logan Paul.

## Rationalizations
 - What is a Rationalization?
   - A moral excuse, a justification for an immoral action
 - Why do we rationalize?
   - To maintain our positive self-image
 - What is the matter with rationalizations?
   - They "short circuit" ethical thinking
   - We forget our duties, others' rights, the action's consequences, and what a virtuous person would do.

### Examples of Rationalizations

Everyone else is doing it. It's normal. Who am I to say it's wrong.

I am taking care of my family, friends, coworkers, or company.

It isn't my call. My boss has ordered me to do it.

There is no point in me losing my position by refusing to do it. My boss will just bring in someone else who will do it.

I am trying to achieve an important goal, and I can't let anythign get in the way of successfully reaching it.

I don't have the luxury of time to do a thorough analysis of this situation.

In the long run, thigs will work out for the best if I do this.

Nobody will get hurt, or at least nobody will get hurt very much.

Yes, it will hurt them, but they are bad people, and they deserve it.

What I'm doing isn't so bad compared to what other people are doing.

Think of all the good things I do.

## Discussion Question
In addition to the rationalizations already presented, what other rationalizations can you think of?

### Cory's answer

This can't be *that* bad.

# Subjective Rationalization

## Relativism and Subjective Relativism

### Ethical relativism
No universal standards of right and wrong.

One person can say "X is right," another can say "X is wrong," and both can be correct

### Subjective relativism
Each person decides right and wrong for themself

What's right for you may not be right for me.

#### Case for Subjective relativism

Well-meaning and intelligent people can disagree

Ethical debates are pointless

#### Case against Subjective relativism

Makes it easy to rationalize. Blurs line between doing what you think is right and doign what you feel like doing.

Makes no mnoral distinction between the actions of different people

Subjective relativism and tolerance are two different things

Decisions may not be based on reason

Conclusion: Not a workable ethical theory.

## Cultural Relativism

### Cultural Relativism in a Nutshell

What is right and wrong depends on a society's actual moral guidelines

These guidelines vary from place to palce and from time to time.

A particular action amy be right in one society at one time and wrong in another society or at another time

### Case for cultural relativism
Different social contexts demand different moral guidelines

It is arrogant for one society to judge another

### Case against cultural relativism

Because two societies do have different moral views, doesn't mean that they ought to have different views

It doesn't explain how moral guidlines are determined

What if there are no cultural norms?

It doesn't account for evolution of moral guidelines.

It provides no way out for cultures in conflict.

Existance of many acceptable practicies does not imply all practices are acceptable (many/any fallacy)

Societies do, in fact, share certain core values

Only indirectly based on reason.

Conclusion: Not a workable ethical theory

## Divine Command Theory

Good Actions: Those aligned with God's will.

Bad actions: Those contrary to God's will.

Holy books reveal God's will

We should use Holy books as moral decision-making guides.

### Case for Divine Command Theory

We owe obediance to our creator

God is all-good and all-knowing

God is the ultimate authority.

### Cases against Divine Command Theory

Different holy books disagree on certain things

Divine command theor is impractical because society is multicultural, secular.

Some modern moral problems not directly addressed in scripture

Based on obediance, not reason

Conclusion: Not a workable ethical theory for our purposes.

## Ethical Egoism.

### Definision of Ethical Egoism

Each person should focus exlusively on their self-interest

Morally right action: that action tat proivides self with maximum long-term benefit.

Ayn Rand, author of *The Fountainhead* and *Atlas Shrugged* espoused a theory akin to ethical egoism, but htis section is **not** a summary of her theory.

### Case for ethical egosim
It is practical, since we are already inclined to do what's best for ourselves

It is better to let other people take care of themselves

The community can benefit when individuals put their well being first

Other moral principles are rooted in the principle of self-interest.

### Case against ethical egoism
An easy moral philosophy may not be the best moral philosophy

We know a lot about what is good for someone else

Self-interest can lead to blatantly immoral behavior.

Other moral principles are superior to principle of self-interest

People who take the good of others into account lead happier lives

By definition, does not respect the ethical point of view

Conclusion: Not a workable ethical theory

## Kantianism

### Critical Importance of Good Will
Good will: the desire to do the right thing

Immanuel Kant: Only thing in the world that is good without qualification is good will.

Reason should cultivate the desire to do the right thing.

### Categorical Imperitive (1st formulation)

Act only from moral rules that you can at the same time will to be universal moral laws.

### Categorical Imperitive (2nd formulation)

Act so that you treat both yourself and other people as ends in themselves and never only as means to an end.

This is usually an easier formulation to work with than the first formulation of the Categorical Imperitive

### Case for Kantianism

Treats all persons as moral equals

Gives all people moral worth as rational, autonomous beings

Holds everyone to the same standard

Produces universal moral guidelines

### Perfect and Imperfect duties

Perfect duty: duty obliged to fulfiill without exception 
 - Example: telling the truth

Imperfect duty: duty obliged to fulfill in general, but not in every instance
 -  Example: Helping others


### Case against Kantianism

 Sometimes no rule adequately characterizes an action

 Sometimes there is no way to resolve a conflict between rules
   - In a conflict between a perfect duty and an inperfect duty, perfect duty prevails

   - In a conflict between two perfect duties, no solution

Kantianism allows no exceptions to perfect duties

Conclusions: Despite weaknesses, a workable ethical theory
