# Course Overview
Studying the structures within languages, in a scientific manner. Mental organization of grammar, things you may say and not realize how it works.

Relationship between the study of language and other fields.

Examples: PHonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, language acquisition, language change, and language variation.

Not based on content of textbook, based on what you need to know for another class in linguistics.

If you want the book, google it for a PDF.

# Project Guidelines
Under Language Projects tab on eLC.

Pick one language that you are interested in and handle a discussion post.

5 discussion posts.


Each post is graded for completion and content.

Prompt that needs to be responded to for each.

Can work with other students in a class if you want to pick the same language, but you must have your own answers.

Extra credit for posts 2345 by responding to another person's discussion post, tips will be in guidelines.

Response should be linguistically relavent to that person's post.

Sources for information must be identified. You may identify it by providing a link to a publicly accessible web site

APA format suggested.

## Picking a language.
Cannot be English or a dialect of it.

https://ethnologue.com/browse/names/

Good link to find quick facts about a language.

Can pick a langauge from a country.

## quick info

Whenever we use slides in this class, it will be posted on eLC.

# Course Content

## What is Linguistics?
Part of the field of cognitive science.

Linguistics is the scientific study of human languages.
-  NOT about learning how to speak a bunch of languages.
- Looks at structures within languages (mainly sounds, words, and sentences)
- Describes how language is actually used, NOT how to speak "correctly"
 - Descriptive, not presriptive

## Presriptive vs Descriptive approaches to Studying Languages

 - Prescriptive: making up rules for how to "properly" speak a language, and deciding how people "should" speak
  - this is NOT what linguists do

 - Descriptive
## topics we will cover
 - Phonetics: identifying and describing sounds
 - Phonology: patterns of sounds
 - Morphology: Structures of words
 - Syntax: structure of sentences
 - Semantics: meaning
 - Pragmatics: meaning in a social context (Sarcasm, dad jokes. rhetorical questions)
 - Language in the brain: neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics, speech disorders
 - Language acquisition: by children, by adults, and being bilinguial.
 - Historical Linguistics: languages changing over time, and into other languages
 - Sociolinguistics and langauge variation (GenZ vs Boomers)
 - Sign languages.

## What do you do with linguistics?
 - Translation for any field
 - Speech and language pathologists and audiologists
 - Government and law enforcement
 - Movie industry
 - Advertising
 - Language instruction
 - Tech

# Language
What is language and what are its characteristics?

## What is language?
Definitions?
 - Way of socialization
 - Social Construct

What makes a language a language?
 - Syntax (different)
 - Different experiences
 - A language as opposed to a dialect: A langage has an army and a navy
 - To linguists a language is an arbitrary system which people use to communicate and express themselves.
   - There are key different key characteristics which must be a part of a communication system for it to be considered a language
 - Humans have *language* while animals have *communication*
 - How many languages are there?
  - 7159 languages currently in use today.
  - Roughly 44% of all languages are now endangered, often with fewer than 1000 users remaining.
  - The world's 20 largest languages are the native tongue of more than 3.7 billion people.

## Displacement
-  Displacment: Ability to talk about things that are not physically in this world and not currently happening.
   - Fairy Godmother
   - Dragons, unicorns
   - Wishing, hoping, planning
   - Yesterday, and tomorrow
 - Human Languages do have displacement, animal communication does not.
 - Animal communication does not have displacement. It is designed for here and now.

## Arbitrariness
 A property of language describing the fact that there is no natural connection a linguistic form and its meaning

 Imagine this is an English word: *clattabatter*
 - Can you tell the meaning?

 Form $ \ne $ meaning. Even for signed languages.

 Sign languages still have words for discussion things that you don't necessarily know what that would look like.

 Most animal signals do have a clear connection of meaning to signal.

 ## Productivity
 Property of a language that allows humans to create an infinite number of new expressiohs

 Novel sentences are understandable

 Most animals have a finite number of signals to use.

  - Fixed signal: Each signal in a communication system is fixed to a specific purpose or concept.

## Recursion
 Ability to make sentences inside of sentences
  - E.g. Luke said that Obi-Wan asked whether Qui-Gon demanded that Yoda said that Anakin would become a Jedi.

Animal communication does not have this property.

## Next class
Phonetics

Do the get you know you survey on eLC if you have not already.
