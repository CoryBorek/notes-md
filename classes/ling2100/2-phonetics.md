## What is phonetics?
The study of sounds that are used in human speech.

Three different types:
 - Articulatory*: What the body parts are doing
 - Acoustic: what the colliding bits of air are doing
 - Auditory: What the ear and brain hear/perceive.

 ## Speech Production
 The air stream originates from the lungs

 Sound is shaped as it passed through the throat and the mouth, sometimes the nose.

 Vocal Cords are scientifically called vocal folds

the parts of the mouth that move are called articulators

# Intro to the IPA
The *International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)* is an  alphabet designed to accurately represent sounds in any spoken language.

![IPA](%RAW_BASE%/%REPO%/refs/heads/%BRANCH%/classes/ling2100/ipa.png)

## Why do we need the IPA?
Used by linguists to correspond 1:1 between symbol and sound

Someone who knows the IPA can understand the sounds of any language, regardless of their language background.


### Why not use another language's alphabet to study sounds?
Sounds for a letter in English is not consistent.

Example: t vs th.

C has multiple sounds.

IPA can be used in order to avoid all problems.

# Sound-Spelling Correspondences

How would you pronounce the world *ghoti*

If you take the gh sound from tough

o from women

ti from nation

 = fish.

 very strange...

## International Phonetic Alphabet

We use this system to write sounds, words, etc. so that we know what it sounds like.

Writing in IPA is called **transcription**

Anytime we use the IPA, we want to surround it with square brackets []

Distinguishes from spelling.

Given as a hand-out. Note: add a screenshot.

# Types of Sounds

**Consonants** narrow or complete closure of the vocal tract

**Vowels**: Very little obstruction of vocal tract

**Glides**: involves movement as the sound is produced.
 - Cannot be held out without changing to a vowel
 - Sometimes called semi-vowels, as they are in between open and constricted

## Consonsants and Glides
Consonants are sounds that are produced with some constriction of airflow in the vocal tract
 - e.g. [t] [k] [b]

Glides have a relatively open vocal tract

English only has two.

[j] and [w]

j like in Jens, w like while.

We describe them in terms of their voicing, place of articulation, and manner of articulation.

Only one on the IPA chart for American English has two locations, as it is a glide, so it has two places of constriction. (w)

\esh (tall streched out s) esh

looks like a weird 3, yogh

Theta $\theta$

eth looks like a cartoon bomb

tap looks like a hook

upside down r is the american r.

eng (or engma) is a n with a hook.

## Voicing

All consonants are either voiced or voiceless.

Depends on the configuration of your vocal folds in the lanrynx.

Open: no vibration: voiceless

Closed: vibration from friction: voiced

[s] is voiceless, [z] is voiced.

On the IPA chart, symbols within some cell are voiced on the right and voice;ess on the left.

in the IPA chart, on the left it voiceless, on right it is voiced.

## Place of articulation
The location along the vocal tract with the greatest constriction.

Place of Articulation isbased on the column

Bilabial involves the lips,

Glottal is in the back of the throat.

### Bilabial
Produced when both lips are together

[p] in pet
[b] in bike
[m] in man

Labiovelar is a sub-type of bilabial and veliar
 - Produced with both lips, rounded and constriction at the velum

[w] in water.

### Labiodental
Produced with the top teeth and bottom lip togeter

[f] in fine

[v] in love

### Interdental

Tip of tounge against or between front teeth

[$\theta$] thigh

[eth] thy

These are tricky to hear, and not a huge difference in English

### Alveolar

Tounge against the front of the alveolar ridge

[t] in truck

[d] in dog

[n] in night
[s] in summer

[z] in zebra
[upside down r] in rat

[l] in lip

[b] in butter

### Postalveolar

Middle of the tongue near or against the back of the alveolar ridge

[esh] in shake

[yoge] measure

[t esh] church

[d yoge] judge

### Palatal

Produced with the middle o the tongue against or very close to the hard pallate

[j] as in yellow.

### Velar
Produced with the back of the tongue against the soft pallate

[k] in cat

[g] in ghost

[n with a hook] in sing

Remember: [w] is made using he velum and the lips, and is a labiovelar sound

### Glottal

Produced with the use of the glottis
[h] in house

[? (glottal stop)] in uh-oh

Common in British English with words like water or British

## Manner of Articulation

Has to do with the configuration/interaction of the articulators and how they shape the airflow while you speak

Articulators = Things in your maouth that move when you talk (lower jar, lips, tongue, velum , etc.)

How does your mouth shape the airflow to make different types of noises.

### Stop (Plosives)

Produced when airflow is completely stopped and suddenly released in a burst after.

In English: [d] in dog

### Fricatives

Produced when the airflow is highly restricted but not completely stopped.

[f] in fish

[v] in vulture

[$\theta$] in thigh

and more

### Affricates

Produced as a combination of a stop and a fricative

Burst of air is a fricitave

In English

ch as in chicken

d3 as in gym or judge

### Nasals

Prodcuced when air is stopped in the oral cavity and redirected through the nasal cavity.

Raising the velum blocks air from the nasal cavity

English:

[n] in night

[m] in might

[n with a hook] as in si*ng*

### Approximants

Produced with very little obstruction and no real frication

Subdivided into liquids and glides

[l] as in like (lateral sound)

[upside down r] in rap (rhotic sound, called a rhotic apprximate)

Glides: produced with less restriction than liquids

[j] in yum

[w] in wind.

### Tap
One articulation quickly toughes another

Similar to the movement for a stop, but there is no buildup of air as it is stopped

No burst of air after

[upside down j] in bi**tt**er
