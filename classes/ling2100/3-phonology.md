# Phonlogy

Phonomes, Sound Patterns, and Organization of sounds

It's about how we say things differently than we think it.

# What is Phonology?
How sounds are organized within a language.

Looks at the study of patterns of speech sounds.

Looks at people's mental organizations of sounds, which includes:
 - How sounds affect each other
 - How sounds within specfic contexts influence our production and understanding of those sounds

Questions we want to ask:
 - How are sounds organized within a language
 - Can we preduct context or occurence
 - ???


Phonetics: Individual Sounds

Phonology: **Mental organization** of sounds

Each language has a sound system.

In phonology, we look at the patterns of sounds within langauges.

## Sound Systems
A good starting point for examining a language system of sounds is identifying what sounds are used in that language.

A Language's **phoneme inventory** is a list of the sounds that are used in a given language

Soe languages use sounds that others do not:

e.g. English uses a lot more vowels,

Zulu uses clicks, but Zulu does.

## Sound Patterns

All languages have rules that are followed for sounds that are organized.

These are called **phonotactic constraints**

Different rules are followed in different languages, and are a little different between accents

e.g. in english, we can't start a word with [zv], but Russian can.

Another example: in Hawaiian, words cannot have two consonants in a row, and they cannot end in a consonant.

## Phonotactic Constraints and Accents
Are one of the biggest reasons why someone might sound like they have a foreign accent.

People get used to the phonotactic constraints in their first language, and use the sound patterns that they're used to in another language

Germans have no interdental sounds, so Germans may use another sound like a [d] or [z].

In the Tashlhiyt dialect of Berber (in southern Morocco) has no vowels, so people from other language backgrounds may want to insert vowels.

## Phonetic Environment Patterns
Nearby sounds may sometimes influence us to sometimes use a diferent production of a sound.

This is based on a sound's phonetic environment, which involves:
 - The position of a sound in a word (or syllable), such as beig at the beginning, or end, AND
 - The sounds that come before and after.
 
 Often, we don't even realize that we are pronouncing certain sounds differently.

 - Think of how you pronounce the p sound in the following words: pit, spit, sip. Each one is different.

 
# Phonemes and Allophones

What is our mental organization of sounds

## Phoneme
Mental representation of one sound in a given language.

Linguists use phonemes as a minimal unit of sounds

It's not actually a sound that you're producing, it's the idea of a sound that you're trying to say.

Using different phonemes can make a difference in the meaning of a word.

e.g. /p/ and /b/

phonemes use a / within it. Can have different variations of the sound, but the letter we represent, is what we think of the "default" one.


## Allophones

Sounds that a re a variation of a phoneme that surfaces only in specific environments

This is the actual prononciation of a dsound. We usually don't realize that we are saying it differently.

Does not make a difference in the meaning:

e.g., [l] and [~l]

*lip*, vs. *pill*

## Phonemes vs. Allophones

Linguists are interested in phonemes and allophones because they help us to understand a particular language.

e.g. Do speakers of the languages X consider [upside down r] and [l] to be the same sound.

- In English, Spanish, and German: No! They're phonemes
- In Japanese, Korean, and Hawaiian: Yes! They're all phonemes

## Identifying Phonemes and Allophones
When we identify whether two sounds are either phonemes or allophones in a particular language, we say either:

The sounds are separate phonemes:
 - Meaning speakers of the language consider these to be two different sounds
 - If you switch the two sounds, speakers might think you're saying a different word

Or: The sounds are allophones of the same phoneme
- Meaning speakers consider these to be the same sound
-

## Phonemes or Allophpnes?

The way we can tell whether a sound is a phoneme or allophone is based on its possible phonetic environment

### Distribution
Where does a sound occur?

This involves the sounds before and after it.
e.g. [b_t]

Not all environments are possible for all sounds, and those rules are langauge-specific.

Distribution is either **complementary** or **contrastive**.

## Complementary vs Contrastive

Phonemes are a contrastive distribution

They are unpredictible based on their environments

Written in /slashes/ in order to indicate it is a mental concept of a sound

Allophones are in complementary distribution

Predictable based on environment

Allophones have to be phonetically similar to one another, meaning that they have some features in common

e.g. not [h] and [eng]

Written in [square brackets]
