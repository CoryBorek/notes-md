# Intro to Language

## What is Linguistics?
Part of the field of cognitive science.

Linguistics is the scientific study of human languages.
-  NOT about learning how to speak a bunch of languages.
- Looks at structures within languages (mainly sounds, words, and sentences)
- Describes how language is actually used, NOT how to speak "correctly"
 - Descriptive, not presriptive

## Presriptive vs Descriptive approaches to Studying Languages

 - Prescriptive: making up rules for how to "properly" speak a language, and deciding how people "should" speak
  - this is NOT what linguists do

 - Descriptive
## topics we will cover
 - Phonetics: identifying and describing sounds
 - Phonology: patterns of sounds
 - Morphology: Structures of words
 - Syntax: structure of sentences
 - Semantics: meaning
 - Pragmatics: meaning in a social context (Sarcasm, dad jokes. rhetorical questions)
 - Language in the brain: neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics, speech disorders
 - Language acquisition: by children, by adults, and being bilinguial.
 - Historical Linguistics: languages changing over time, and into other languages
 - Sociolinguistics and langauge variation (GenZ vs Boomers)
 - Sign languages.

# Language
What is language and what are its characteristics?

## What is language?
Definitions?
 - Way of socialization
 - Social Construct

What makes a language a language?
 - Syntax (different)
 - Different experiences
 - A language as opposed to a dialect: A langage has an army and a navy
 - To linguists a language is an arbitrary system which people use to communicate and express themselves.
   - There are key different key characteristics which must be a part of a communication system for it to be considered a language
 - Humans have *language* while animals have *communication*
 - How many languages are there?
  - 7159 languages currently in use today.
  - Roughly 44% of all languages are now endangered, often with fewer than 1000 users remaining.
  - The world's 20 largest languages are the native tongue of more than 3.7 billion people.

## Displacement
-  Displacment: Ability to talk about things that are not physically in this world and not currently happening.
   - Fairy Godmother
   - Dragons, unicorns
   - Wishing, hoping, planning
   - Yesterday, and tomorrow
 - Human Languages do have displacement, animal communication does not.
 - Animal communication does not have displacement. It is designed for here and now.

## Arbitrariness
 A property of language describing the fact that there is no natural connection a linguistic form and its meaning

 Imagine this is an English word: *clattabatter*
 - Can you tell the meaning?

 Form $ \ne $ meaning. Even for signed languages.

 Sign languages still have words for discussion things that you don't necessarily know what that would look like.

 Most animal signals do have a clear connection of meaning to signal.

 ## Productivity
 Property of a language that allows humans to create an infinite number of new expressiohs

 Novel sentences are understandable

 Most animals have a finite number of signals to use.

  - Fixed signal: Each signal in a communication system is fixed to a specific purpose or concept.

## Recursion
 Ability to make sentences inside of sentences
  - E.g. Luke said that Obi-Wan asked whether Qui-Gon demanded that Yoda said that Anakin would become a Jedi.

Animal communication does not have this property.
