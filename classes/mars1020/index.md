What is my philosophy of Science?

My philosophy, is that everything is science. We ask ourselves questions, and come up with theories, and do our best to solve problems to find the answers through experimentation.

This works in my field, but also heavily works in the business world. Even in arts, there are core themes and problems that are solved and hidden in stories.
