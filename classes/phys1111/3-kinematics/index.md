## About the vectors
For vectors in one dimension,

 - There are only tw odirections
 - Direction can be indicated simply by adding an algebraic sign (i.e. + or -)

## Restriting Motion
 Restricting motion to one dimension allows us to describe vectors using a single component.

 The sign of the component tells us the direction of the vector, based o nthe chosen coordinate system.


## Coordinate System
In order to fully describe motion, we need to set up a coordinate system

- Define a coordinate axis and decide on a scale.

## Position, Distance, and Displacement

Origin: x = 0.

$x_i$ and $x_f$ are the initial and final positions of a person.

An Arrow $ \rightarrow$ indicates the positive direction.

Motion will be either right/left or up/down.

Position is a vector quantity.

The direction is important.

# Distance
Distance is the total length of travel.

*The odometer in a car* measures the distance the car travels.

Distance is a scalar quantity, and is always non-negative.

Does not have a direction.

If you are 2.1 miles away from a friend's house, then the round trip distance is 4.2 miles

# Displacement
Displacement is the change in position from one point to another.

For 1-D systems, we can simply use the sign of the  component to indicate direction

displacement = final position - initial position

$\Delta x = x_f - x_i$

Delta $\Delta$ is a greek symbol, meaning that it is the "change in position"

The displacement vector $\Delta x$ points from the initial position to the final position.

### Question
True or false: in 1D motion, the distance travelled will always be greater than or equal to the magnitude of the displacement vector

**True**!

## House example
If you walk to your friend's house and back, 2.1 miles in total,

your displacement will be 0!.

If you start and end in the same place, your displacement will be 0.

## Notation
Distance is a scalar quality.

Often represented by $D, d, L, l$

Dispalccement is a vector quanity, so includes direction.

Often represented by: $\Delta x, \Delta \vec{x}. \Delta y, \Delta \vec{y}$

# 2 Dimensions!
## Position Vectors in 2D.

The position vector $r$ points from the origin to the location of the object.

$\vec{r} = x\vec{x} + y\vec{y}$

Displacement vector $\Delta r$ points from the inital position to the final position.

$\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_f - \vec{r}_i$

## 2D Example: Bike Ride

Prof. Vector Addition needs to get from his home to his office on the campus of Thomas Watson Institude of Technology. He rides his bycicle south on Galileo St. for 0.5 km, then turns Left 30 degrees onto Franklin Freeway and travels another 4.0 km, a which point he turns due west on Darwin Drive and travels another 1.0 km to arrive at the TWIT campus.

a.) What are the "east" and "north" components of the total displacement vector

b.) What are  the length and direction (relative to east) of the displacement vector.

We are going to sketch a picture of the prolem for ourselves so that we can solve the parts of the problem.

Pick a coordinate system or coordinate axis, sketch on a scale.

When you draw it (specially when taking right or left turns) imagine you as the bycicle rider.

Draw a vector half a kilometer down for South.

A turn left will go East, Draw a line that goes for 3 km going to the right, or East.

Next, we turn Left 30 degrees, so we will draw an arrow 4 km long going about 30 degrees

Our last part goes due west, so we will draw a 1km long vector going there.

An arrow from the origin, to the end of the last arrow is our final amount.

With the example drawing, we should have a positive x and y component.

Solving it, has some x and y components.

$\Delta x = 3.0 km + (4.0 km)\cos 30\degree - 1km = 5.5 km$

$\Delta y = -0.5 + (4.0km)\sin30\degree = 1.5 km$
