## Lon-CAPA
First Lon-CAPA homework not due unti 8/27

Will open on Monday once we have covered some of the material.

## Quizzes
on eLC under tools.

If there is a discrepancy, eLC is correct.

## Lost items
If you forget somethhing after class, it will be in the main office in the Physics building.

Will be with the receptionist.

## Logistics Attendance:

Attendance is via TopHat and answering questions

Can mis up to 20% of these classes for no penalty.

If you are a few mins late, its fine, enter quietly and take your seat.

Generally if you regularly miss class, you tend to do worse.

# Scalars vs Vectors

## Scalars
A quantity with only a value, no direction

10 meters, 10 seconds, 100 pounds

In general can be positive, negative, or zero. but physical meaning can restrict this.


## Vectors
A quantity with magnitude and direction

ex: 10m to North

Typically represented with an arrow.

The arrow points in the direction of the vector, and the length of the arrow is proportional to he magnitude of the vector (a scale relates the rrow lenght to the vector magnitude)

You cannot compare magnitudes of vectors of different quantities (e.g. velocity and acceleration)


# Specifying Vector Quantities
Twop useful choices for specifying vector quantities

## 1. Components:
Set up a coordinate system, e.g. E and N, x and Y and specify how much of the vector lies along each direction

## 2. Magnitude and Direction
State the magnitude and specify direction by an angle relative to some reference direction by and angle relative to some reference direction

For exmaple: 5km 36.9deg North of East

Both methods are useful and we'll need to convert back and forth.

Bars around a vector is a magnitude, and its scalar value.

$\theta$ is the angle.


# 1D Vectors
For vectors in one dimension (i.e. along a straight line)

Only two directions (left/right, up/down)

Canh be indicated by attaching an algebraic sign ( + or -) to the magnitude, where the positive direction has been previously specified.

This is really the component of the vector along the axis, but because the vector lies along the axis, it is sufficient to fully specify the vector.

# 2D Vectors

If we have a vector **A** in x-y coordinate plane

## 2D Vector Components
Given a 2D vector, how do we find its components

First, set up the coordinate axis,

Place the origin at the tail of the vector

Then draw perpendicular lines from the tip to the axes Where they hit the aces are the components

In the example in the slides, X is positive ( $ A_x > 0 $ ), y is negative ( $ A_y < 0 $ ).

## Position vector
points from the origin to the location of the object.

has an arrow on top

Unit vectors $\hat{x}, \hat{y}$

$\hat{x}$ is a dimensionless vector of unit length 1 in the positive x direction

$\hat{y}$ is the same but in +y

For Vector $\vec{A}$

we have $A_x \hat{x}$ and $A_y \hat{y}$

$A_x = A\cos(\theta)$

$A_y = A\sin(\theta)$

Choice of $\sin$ and $\cos$ depends on the angle given.

remember SOHCAHTOA.

## Limiting Cases
Pick a few cases where we know what the answer should be, to determine where sign and cos go

If angle is 0, or 90 degrees where sin and cos go.

## Back to Components
We can switch between the components using standard trigonomic relations.

If we wanted to find what the angle is, we can find the actual angles.

## Calculators
Make sure you use degrees / radians when the problem requires each one.

## Signs of Components

Signs of the components relate to which quadrant the vector points into from the origin.

## Hint: Jogging Distance:
A Jogger runs 12 m due west, then changes direction for the second leg of her run. At the end of the run, she is 306 m away from the starting point at an angle of 16 degrees north of west. What is the length of her second displacement?


Use a "backwards" coordinate system. Then North of west is the "standard" angle we use.

# Adding and Subtracting Vectors

## Graphically
One way we can add and subtract vectors is graphically.

Place the tail of the second vector at the head of the first, and so on. The vector sum points from the tail of the first vector, to the head of the last vector.

Vectors can be moved to other locations without changing them, so long as their magnitude and direction are preserved.

## Using Components

Find the components of each vector to add.

Add up all the x and y components separately.

Find the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector.


$\vec C = \vec A + \vec B$

$C_x = A_x + B_x$

$C_y = A_y + B_y$

$|\vec C| = \sqrt{C_x^2 + C_y^2}$

## Various Notations
$\vec C = \vec A + \vec B$


$C_x + A_x + B_x$

$C_y + A_y + B_y$

$\vec C = (A_x + B_x)\hat{x} + (A_y| B_y)\hat{y}$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
C_x \\ C_y
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
A_x \\ A_y
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
B_x \\ B_y
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Subtracting Vectors

The negative of a vector is a vectior with the same magnitude pointing in the oppisite direction



$\vec{A} - \vec A = 
\vec a + (-\vec A) = 0$

Thus, to subract one vector from another, reverse the direction of he subtracted vector and add the result to the first vector.

### Component-wise subtraction
$\vec C = \vec A - 
\vec B$

$C_x = A_x - B_x$

$C_y = A_y - B_y$
