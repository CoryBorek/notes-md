# Freely falling objects
Air resistance complicates matters.; In this course we will ignore it, but remember it is still there.

This means that it is not completely accurate, but good enough.

An object is in free fall if it is subject only to the influence of gravity.

Any object in free fall (near the surface of the earth) experiences the same accelleration, about $9.81 m/s^2$ straight down, regardless of mass or size.

The magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity varies from place to place.

This is because the earth is not a perfect sphere.

Assume that the constant $g = 9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}$.

$g$ is always positive. If there is a negative amount, we will put the negative somewhere else.

Keep it outside the constant. Use a plus or minus depending on the direction you need.

Most of the time, up is positive, though not always the case.
