# Introduction

Textbook is free to view online, via openstax. Professor doesn't often use it, so we'll use the free version.

All problems are through homework platform.

Pre-lecture videos will be given before class.

5-10 minute videos, some by UGA professors, some by others.

Little quizzes that go with the video, graded by completeness. Full credit upon attempt.

Will be posted through eLC.

Typically due at Noon on day of class. About 2/3 of classes will have one.

Tophat will have in-class questions. (Instructions are on eLC.)

Multiple attempts allowed, most problems have eight attempts.

First assignment not due for a little while.

# Homework Tips
This is a chance to practice and understand the material.

More supplementary.

Do not use Chegg/ChatGPT, as it may be inaccurate, and may make it harder to learn.

Read the questions carefully.

Draw a picture! It may help!

Make lists of what the problem gives you and what it is asking for.

Try to work in symbols as much as you can. This can improve your understanding of the material and it's also easier to check your work.

2 - Oct 10th

3 - Nov 7th

Final: December 4th 7-10 PM, Room TBD.

Scantron Multiple choice exams, more details to come. For accomodations, use the A&T testing center.

# A few physics principles

Physcal diagrams are very important. Sketch out the situation and the infroamtion you know.

Final answer is essential, but the process is critical, so showing your work (diagrams, intermediate math steps) is a must in this class.

Correct units and order of magnitude are very important.

Many solutions can exist for the same problem.

# Expectations
There are 420 students in both sections, and one profesor. Plan accordingly for sponse time and interactions.

Goal of this course and college more boardly: become an independent learner.

You are responsible for putting in the effort to get the grade you want; I can't care about your grade more than you do.

Personalized feedback will be limited.

The difficulty of this course will ebb and flow. That's normal. Pace may also flow.

We have lives beyond this course.
