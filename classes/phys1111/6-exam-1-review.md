Want to predict grades, to build an app. Has a survey asking to participate in the study, will get some class participation credit

# Practice Problem 4
Uga XI is chasing a football before a game. He can run with a speed of 4 m/s relative to still air.

a.) if the ball is 20 m away and he runs at a constant speed, how long will it take to reach the ball?

b.) Suppose now that there is a strong wind perpendicular to Uga XI's path with a speed of 3 m/s relative to the ground. If he had wanted to move in with a straight line toward the ball, at what angle should he run?

c.) How long will it take Uga XI to reach the ball now assuming the ball is unaffected by the wind?

$s_{uga} = 4 \ m/s$

$d_{ball} = 20\ m$

a.) $\frac{20 \ m}{4\ m/s} = 5\ s$

b.) $v_{uga,wind} = 4\ m/s, v_{wind,ground} = 3 \ m/s$

$\vec{v_{uga,ground}} = \vec{v_{uga,wind}} + \vec{v_{wind,ground}$

$\vec{v_{uga,ground_x}} = \vec{v_{uga,wind_x}} + 0$

$0 = v_{uga,wind_y} + v_{uga_ground_y}$

$0 = -4\ m/s \sin \theta + 3\ m/s$

$4\ m/s \sin \theta = 3 m /s$

$\sin \theta = \frac{3}{4}$

$\theta = \arcsin(\frac{3}{4}) = 48.5\degree$

c.)
