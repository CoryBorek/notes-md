13 Multiple Choice questions, Scan tron

Some need no calculator, Some need a calculator.

Taken out of 11. Can miss 3 questions to get an A.

Some scores may be curved as needed.

Curve will only go up.

## Practice Exam 1
on eLC with formula sheet and solutions.

Guide for what to prepare for. Not all topics will be on exam. Same otherwise.

Use it as a guide to test where you are at.

Exam will not be the same questions on the practice exam.

Questions will be topically similar, but not the same.

e.g. view the football question as an example of projectile motion, not as an example of a football question on the exam.

Tips for studying:

Try the practice exam under exam like conditions first. Note what difficulties you encountered, then look at notes, answer key, ask for help.

i.e. try the problems alone, use the formula sheet, don't look at other notes, etc.

practice, practice, practice.

Think like a professor based on what we've done in class and on the homeworks, how would you fit as many topics into 50 mins as possible?

## Self-care

Get a good night's sleep

Do eat, exercise, etc.

Hollistic exam only counts for 10% of your score.

## Approach to studying

Space it out. 1 hour each day for two days is better than 2 hours one day.

Start early, don't wait until the last minute

Self-quizzing, practice problems, more effective

Reflect on what you didn't know, find similarities and differences between similar problems.

Find similarities and differences between the problems.

# Definition
An object moving on a circular path at constant speed is said to be undergoing uniform circular motion.

Velocity vector is tangent to the circular path.

Velocity direction keeps changing as the object moves

Even though speed is constant, velocity vector is not constant.

## Direction of Acceleration
Since the vector keeps changing its direction toward the interior of the circle, the acceleration vector must point radially inward.

$a = \frac{v^2}{r}$

Acceleration is larger for faster speed v.

Acceleration is smal,ler for larger radius r.

## More about Acceleration

$\omega = $ Angular Speed

$\omega = \frac{v}{r}$

$T = $ Period

$time = \frac{distance}{speed}$

$T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi r}{v}$

acceleration = a

$a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r = \frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$

# Example

A Satellite in geostatrionary orbit above the Earth's equator has a radial acceleration of $0.223 \ m/s^2$

"Geospatial Orbit" means the satellite stays above the same spot on the earth's surface

$a_r \ 0.223 \ m/s^2$

$T = 1$ day $ = 86,400 \ s$.

$a_r = v^2/r = \frac{1}{r}(\frac{2\pi r}{T})^2 = \frac{1}{r} * \frac{4\pi^2r^2}{T^2} = \frac{4\pi&2r}{T^2}$

$r = \frac{a_rT^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{(0.223\ m/s^2)(7.46 * 10^9 \ s^2)}{4pi^2} = 4.21 * 10^7\ m$

# Example: Fair Rides

A fairground ride spins its occupants inside a flying saucer-shaped container. If the horizantal circular path the riders follow has an 8.00 m-radius, at how many revolutions per minute are the riders subjected to a centripetal acceleration equal to that of gravity (g).

$a_r = 9.81 m/s^2$

$a_r = \omega^2r$

$\frac{a_r}{r} = \omega^2$

$\sqrt{\frac{a_r}{r}} = \omega$

$\sqrt{\frac{9.81\ m/s^2}{8\ m}}$

$w_3 = 1.107 \ rad/s * \frac{1\ rev}{2\pi \ rad} * \frac{60 \ sec}{1 \ min} = 10.7 \ rev/min$

# Another Exame
An amusement park is designing a new roller coaster. The coaster will start from rest and then accelerate at a constant rate of $3\ m/s^2$ for the first 150 m of track. At that point, it will maintain its speed and go up around a circular bend. The designers want the acceleration during this part to be 1g. After that, they coasterw will be pulled up the first hill.

a.) What will be the speed of the coaster just before it enters the bend

b.) How long will it take the coaster to reach the bend?

c.) How large of a radius must the circular bend have assuming the conditions of uniform circular motion?



 $\Delta x = 150\ m$

 $a = 3 \ m/s^2$
a.)

 $v_f^2 = 0 + 2a \Delta x$

 $v_f = \sqrt{2a\Delta x}$

 $\sqrt{2(3\ m/s^2)(150\ m)}$

b.) $v_f = 0 + at$

$30 \ m/s = 3\ m/s^2 * t$

$t = 10\ s$

c.)

$a_r = \frac{v^2}{R}$

$R = \frac{v^2}{a_r}$

$\frac{(30\ m/s)^2}{9.81 \ m/s^2} = $ ~300 m.
