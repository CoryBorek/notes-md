# Project Stardust
This is a productivity product that I started back in 2022, to help with my struggles with executive functioning. I started to write some software to help others with it dating as far back as 2019, though that is when I started to take it somewhat seriously.

### The Idea
I want to make a platform that helps people avoid the decision nightmare of where to start then a million things have to be done.

### Early Tests
I spent a week in the Spring of 2023, in which I only used a developer build of Project Stardust to organize my time, and I got more done in a week, than I did in two months. It seems to help me, and I want it to help others.

## What's happened lately?
I was accepted into the [University of Georgia's Idea Accelerator](https://www.terry.uga.edu/entrepreneurship/uga-accelerator/) in late September, and the program started on October 7th. Currently, along with my schoolwork, I am working on seeing if the product is a viable option. This is an intensive program, so we'll see how it goes!

## Notes/Articles
If I ever write any notes or articles, they will be available on this site (for now at least). I have also written, alongside Aiden (who has stepped back from the company) [Medium Progress Reports](https://medium.com/@agentdid127/list/alium-progress-reports-be3e66842afd).
