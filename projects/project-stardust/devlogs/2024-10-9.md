# Devlog for October 9th 2024

Hello! This document is in-progress, so be aware that things will update throughout the day.

## GOOD MORNING CAMP!

I ended up waking up later than I would have liked to, but that's okay. In terms of what needs to be done today, I need to reach out to a specific number of people.

Yesterday, I managed to reach 13 people, and get one person to fill out the form. It's definitely a good start so far. Unfortunately, that was not enough people to reach out to.

Each day this week, I need to reach about 17 different people. As I am a little behind today, I'll need to catch up and reach out to 21 different people.

Yesterday, I started to make a list of people to target and contact. Today, I will finish out that list with the amount of people I need to contact. Hopefully the communication sticks a little more today.

At this point, I'm going to start finding those contacts, so I'll hopefully update this a little later.

## Notice
This day is still in progress. ***Things will change***.
