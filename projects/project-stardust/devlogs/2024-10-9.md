# Devlog for October 9th 2024

At the point that I am writing this, it is currently 8:39 PM on October 8th, so I am starting a little bit early.

## Plans for the day:
This section is copied from the previous day, as the day is yet to start.

As I fell a little bit short today, I will have to get 20 messages out tomorrow. My approach is going to be a little bit different, as I want to throw as many things at the wall that I can to see what sticks.

I spent part of today looking at different social media groups for people who struggle with executive functioning. As of yet, I have a list of about 12 people, of whom I will try to contact tomorrow. I'm hoping to keep looking towards building a list of people to contact, and sending that out.

I also will be going to a support group for students who struggle with it (I go regularly anyways), and I'll see what sticks with them as well, as they fit into my target audience.

Most of my day tomorrow will be spent on campus for this. I have an 8 am class, so I have to get up early for it. As this is what I am working on, Let's look at my planned schedule:

 
|   Hour  | Task |

| 6:15 AM | Wake up, get ready to leave |
| 6:50 AM | Drive to Vet Med Campus, get ready to catch bus |
