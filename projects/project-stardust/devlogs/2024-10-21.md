# Devlog for October 21st 2024

This week's meeting was quite a bit.

## My Presentation
There were a bunch of takeaways from my presentation.

Sometimes, people may have a different problem than you, and will focus on their problem instead of the one you are proposing. That is fine, but you may not be asking at the right time.

A lot of my messages were just me trying to offer something. I should try to be a litle more organic.

One way to do that, would be to talk about my own diagniosises and experiences.

We should also focus on our customer, and how we can help them.

There are a couple of ways to do this:
 - Find posts about the problem, respond with solution
 - Find different avenues to post through.

## Pitch
We will also have the opportunity to pitch our companies to a bunch of local investors.

This will be a 3 minute presentation, followed by a 3-minute Q&A.

In order for this to happen, we must have everything ready as if we were going to present on Monday next week.

We will have Tuesday to refine our slides, though we will have to submit them Tuesday Night.

There will be a prize of $2,500, and our goal for the prize should be to continue running more tests, and get started.

A good way to learn how to pitch, is to watch both Tech Stars, and Y-Combinator Pitches.
