# Devlog for October 21st 2024

watch tech stars and Y-combinator pitches

3 min presentation, 3 min Q&A.

Must show up on Monday with fully formed slides and presentation. Ready as if I am going to present on Wednesday.

Will edit pitch between Monday and Wednesday.

Slides are usually due Tuesday Night.


Sometimes people have a different problem. focused on that instead of your problem.

Try to be organic.

Maybe start talking about my experiences with my own diagnosis?

Must be curious, look further into it.

focus more on the customer other than themselves.


keep refining channel and message.

Message seems like i am trying to sell something, which isn't that helpful.

Possibly find posts about the problem, and respond to the thread with my solution.

Purpose of a pitch is to see if there is interest, with the approach of getting a follow-up, or wanting them to learn more.

Watch Tech Stars and Y-Combinator pitches.

Ask for $2500, goal is to get more customers, and run further tests.
