# Project Stardust Development Logs
This is a page to store information on the Development and effort that goes into Project Stardust.

## A quick notice:

This site is not designed to look pretty, or for anything written to be completely legible. It is purely for me to have a log of what I have worked on, and to get my thoughts down on paper (or on the computer in this instance).

It is available for people to see, as I will most likely condense things down into easier to read articles in the future, most likely on Medium, though that is a problem for Future Cory.

With that warning in place, below are the articles that you can read.
