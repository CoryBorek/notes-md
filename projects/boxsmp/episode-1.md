# Episode 1

This is the first episode of the series.

I have an early recording that is about 3 hours long, that will need to be cut down into clips to get started.

I may add some cut clips of me talking to the camera in between of the early parts.

Ideally, I would like to build a couple of buildings in the style that is mentioned [here](%WEBPATH%/projects/boxsmp/base-plans).

I already built a quick home to start in, though I would like to build an early town square.\

Something that I mentioned with lavathor, is perhaps having a harbor that links in with his water base.

That will probably be a long-term goal for that though...

In the meantime, planning out things, and getting my feet in the ground with the community.
