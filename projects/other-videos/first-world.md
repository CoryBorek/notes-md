# Revisiting my First Minecraft World

I want to revisit my first Minecraft world: "water town life".

It looked terrible, but I loved it when I was 10 years old. This month marks me playing Minecraft for 12 years.

I think it's time that I revisit this world on camera and upgrade it.

I can use this world as a venue for telling my story and experience with this game.

I love Minecraft. October of 2025 marks me playing this game for 12 years. I think it's time for a little reflection to celebrate how far we've come.

I was 10 years old when I first started playing Minecraft. A bunch of my close friends at school were playing it at the time, and after watching my cousin play it, I thought it was just awesome, and pursuaded my dad to buy me a copy of the game.

At this point, I was using my dad's old work laptop, a beefy thing at the time that ran Windows XP. I didn't care about framerates, how my builds looked, how much content I could make. I only cared about the fun of being in the moment. Playing the game.

I remember my first few months in the game playing on my first Minecraft world. I called it "water town life". I think it's about time to revisit this part of my life, and see where we have come to today.

This is Water Town Life, my first Minecraft World. It may not look pretty, but my 10 year old self loved spending time here. This world was from a different era of the game. There was no elytra, so moving around was slow. This world was created just as 1.7 was released. This is where I fell in love with this game.

As I revisit this world, I think it's about time to give it a makeover. Rebuild and terraform it into the world my 10 year old self would have dreamed to have.
