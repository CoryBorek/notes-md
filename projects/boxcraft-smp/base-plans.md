# Base Plans
For this series, I plan to build a starter base that involves some early US history, by making all of my builds from the early colonial US.

Each building will have to be in the style of a building that was built between 1500 and 1787.

For example:

 ![Nassau Hall](https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/colonials-patriots/images/sitec24a.jpg "Nassau Hall")

 This image is of Nassau Hall, which is on the Princeton University Campus.

 It is the oldest building on the campus, and had served as a temporary home for the early US congress, during the period of which we had the Articles of Confederation.

 One of my early build plans is to rebuild this building in Minecraft, with a custom interior.

 This will serve as a storage area and home.

 Other buildings will be used for farms and other plans.
