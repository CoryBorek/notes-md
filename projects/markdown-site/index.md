# Markdown Site
My Markdown site is the culmination of what you see here!

It is a web program, developed in React that displays markdown, based on files in a public Git repository.

This means that once the site is built, nothing new needs to happen.

The source for that is available [here](https://github.com/CoryBorek/markdown-site).

There's been a few changes over the last few weeks that I have been developing it, so my changelogs can be seen in the index after this.
