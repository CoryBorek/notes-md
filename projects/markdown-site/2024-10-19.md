# Changelog for October 19th 2024

Today, there were a few changes to the Markdown site.

The biggest feature that was added, was support for Code blocks. The visuals of these code blocks are based on Github's colors.

That means that I can show code.

For example, I added one of my old class notes to this site.

As a showcase, here is a quick C program.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/*
 * Hello World Program.
 */
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
} // main
```

Other than that, I refactored the top-level Markdown object into a `<MD />` React object.

My code for it now looks something like this.

```js
/**
 * MarkdownFile
 * props - React Properties
 * Returns - Markdown view of text.
 */
const MarkdownFile = (props) => {

    const markdown = "### hello there!"
    return (
        <div>
            <MD>
            {markdown}
            </MD>
        </div>
    )
}
```

Now, it is much easier to work on the site!
