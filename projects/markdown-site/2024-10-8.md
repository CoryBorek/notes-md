# Changelog for October 8th 2024

This file was written quite a bit later than the original date, so please keep the unknowns in mind.

Around this time, this Markdown site was set into its first completed state.

This means that certain things were achieved.

 - [x] Basic Markdown Support for pages
 - [x] Basic LaTeX support
 - [x] Pages ending in a / go to index.md, others go to specific pages.
 - [x] Markdown pulls from a Git Repository

 among others that I am probably forgetting.
