# Overseasons Minecraft Server

## Current
The Overseasons Minecraft Server functions with three servers as of now:

1.) Studios Server (Hub)
2.) Creative Server (Plotworld)
3.) Survival SMP Server

We also have the following two seasonal servers:

a.) Short Term Events (Build Battle, other 1-2 day things)
b.) Long Term Events (some custom minigame, etc.)

## Idea
Turn Overseasons into its own custom game and gamemode.

Main area is like a large MMO game (think club penguin) where you walk around, meet people, chat, and solve quests.

Then there would be some built-in minigames or dungeons that people will solve.

You can earn items and tokens by playing (maybe the tokens could be used on Discord as well)

The Battle game mode will function like the video game Overwatch, in which you work towards either providing a lot of damage, being a bit of a tank, or healing. Different items that you earn from quests / dungeons can help with the battle mode.

Dungeons, would function as a way to get items (think Tango Tek's Decked Out as inspiration).

Things will somewhat reset during different seasons (meaning only certain quests are available during certain seasons / dungeon variants)

Battle mode can be accessed via a button in the hotbar, while other quests / gamemodes are accessed by either talking to people, or walking through portals (think the current hub)

The Overseasons Studios server will slowly move away from being the main hub, to being an area for some special quests, to being purely an event space, and staff area.
