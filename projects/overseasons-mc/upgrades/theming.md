# Overseasons Server Theme

You awaken yourself in a new world, with everlasting goals and conquest. Try to talk to new people throughout the server to slowly find out where you are and what to do.

## Quests

 - Archer's Quest
   - Talk to two people holding a bow, eventually earn the Archer's set (Infinity/Unbreakable bow / arrow)
   - Starter DPS set
 - Warrior's Quest
   - Talk to the warrior hermit in the cave. Get them a coffee.
     - Receive Iron Armor / Sword (Tank Set)
 - Mage's Quest
   - Talk to the sleeping guard. Will take you to a tent off in the distance
   - Talk to the mage in the tent (Will give you splash potions of healing / damage) (Healer set)

## Dungeons
These are other ways to get items / sets. Usually part of quests

Think Decked Out in terms of how they function, but you use your sets in them to fight mobs and evade dangers.

## Battle Mode
The primary game mode. Based on Overwatch. Only version of this to test is "push". Will be somewhat competitive, and is accessed by walking to different arenas, or using an item in the hotbar.

Can earn competitive ranks from it (future development)
Will also earn Overseasons Currency from quests and winning in battle mode.
